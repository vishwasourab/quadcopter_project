## Quadcopter Project

In this project, I will train a quadcopter to perform certain tasks (**Hovering and Landing**) using Reinforcement Learning Algorithms.

### Files:
* ```task.py:``` Tasks are defined in this file
* ```agents/agent.py:``` The RL agent is developed in this file
* ```physics_sim.py:``` Contains simulator for the quadcopter


I used Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient ([DDPG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971)) algorithm to develop my agent.
